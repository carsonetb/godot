# MultiGodot

MultiGodot is a modification of the Godot Engine, which is designed
to add multi-user functionality to the engine. You can collaborate 
with as many people as you like on a project! Edit scenes together,
watch another person edit a script, etc.

The project is currently in a pre-alpha phase meaning:

  - It is absolutely not suitable for use as of right now
  - I would love if you submitted issues or PRs or just gave it 
    a try.
  - There are probably bugs around every corner, most likely some 
    features that need to be synchronized which I missed.
